the AI Tarot

This app is created with react.js, and uses the { useContext } and { useReducer } hooks to toggle between a "light" mode and a "dark" mode.
In this app, however, we refer to them as "dream" mode and "nightmare" mode - as the array of cards is also set to toggle, according to the theme. 
All card images are created with midjourney Ai and are one of a kind.
I had a fun time creating this, and it is still very much a work in progress.
